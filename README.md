# Express TypeScript Template

This repository contains a boilerplate structure for setting up an Express application with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sm0483/ts-express-template.git
cd ts-express-template
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the Express server on the default port (usually 5000). You can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## Building the Application

To build the application, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript and place the output in the dist folder.
